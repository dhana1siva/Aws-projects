Access S3 from Private EC2 instance using VPC Endpoint:
==========================================================

First we understand about what is Vpc endpoint

VPC Endpoint allows us to securely connect our VPC and supported AWS services powered by AWS PrivateLink.

AWS PrivateLink is a service that allows you to access AWS services by using private IP addresses. In this case, traffic does not leave Amazon’s network.

VPC endpoint does not require a NAT Gateway, NAT instance, Internet Gateway, or any VPN services to access AWS Services.

There are two types of VPC endpoints: 

*Gateway
*Interface.

VPC endpoint for S3 comes under Gateway endpoint.

When you create a VPC endpoint for S3, it asks for the Route table, then it adds the Prefix list to that route table. 
You can’t modify/delete the entry present in the route table, created by Endpoint.
